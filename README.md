# Cloud Portfolio Challenge Load Balancing and CDN - AI Image Service

A **Cloud Portfolio Challenge** implementation showcasing modern cloud architecture with load balancing, CDN, and intelligent AI image generation using Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK).

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

This project showcases **two independent deployment architectures** that can run simultaneously:

### 🚀 Full Deployment (Digital Ocean) - "Pricy"
Production-grade infrastructure with complete AI capabilities:
- **Load Balancer**: Digital Ocean Load Balancer distributing traffic across multiple full-stack droplets
- **Full-Stack Droplets**: Each droplet runs Go API server, Next.js frontend, and Nginx reverse proxy
- **Automated Deployment**: UserData script handles complete application setup with dedicated service user
- **CDN**: Digital Ocean Spaces CDN for fast global image delivery and log storage
- **Multi-Provider Intelligence**: ADK-powered orchestrator managing multiple AI image providers
- **Managed Database**: Valkey (Redis-compatible, VPC-only) for caching and session management
- **Cost**: ~$68/month

### 🪶 Lite Deployment (GitHub Pages) - "Cheap"
Cost-optimized static deployment with feature flags:
- **Platform**: GitHub Pages (completely free)
- **Frontend**: Static Next.js export with pre-generated images
- **Feature Flags**: Demonstrates production-grade deployment practices
- **Voting**: Local browser-only tracking (no backend)
- **Images**: Served from DO Spaces CDN
- **Cost**: $5/month (DO Spaces + CDN, GitHub Pages is free)

### 🔄 Blue/Green Deployment Strategy
Both deployments can run independently for testing:
- Full deployment on DO Load Balancer IP
- Lite deployment on GitHub Pages URL
- DNS cutover workflow for seamless switching
- Zero-downtime migration between deployments

```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Infrastructure Deployment
Deploy the complete infrastructure to Digital Ocean:

```bash
cd hosting
pulumi up
```

**👉 [Infrastructure Setup Guide](hosting/README.md)**

### 2. Backend Service
Start the AI image generation API:

```bash
cd backend
export FREEPIK_API_KEY=your_key
export GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_key
export LEONARDO_API_KEY=your_key
go run cmd/server/main.go
```

**👉 [Backend Documentation](backend/README.md)**

### 3. Frontend Application
Launch the image comparison interface:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

## 🤖 AI Provider Research

Explore individual AI image generation providers and their capabilities:

| Provider | Status | Features | Documentation |
|----------|--------|----------|---------------|
| **Freepik** | ✅ Integrated | Official API, $5 free credit, sync generation | [📖 Guide](research/freepik/README.md) |
| **Google Imagen** | ✅ Integrated | High-quality Imagen 3.0, Vertex AI | [📖 Guide](research/google-imagen/README.md) |
| **Leonardo AI** | ✅ Integrated | Creative models, async generation, free tier | [📖 Guide](research/leonardo-ai/README.md) |
| **Craiyon** | ❌ Broken | Cloudflare protection blocks API access | [📖 Guide](research/craiyon/README.md) |

## 🎯 Key Features

### Intelligent Provider Management
- **Google ADK Integration**: Orchestrator agent with automatic provider selection
- **Reactive Fallback**: Seamlessly switches providers when quotas are hit
- **Cost Optimization**: Prioritizes free tiers and manages API costs intelligently

### Production-Ready Architecture
- **Load Balancing**: Distributes traffic across multiple full-stack droplet instances
- **CDN Integration**: Global content delivery via Digital Ocean Spaces
- **Automated Deployment**: UserData script handles complete setup (apps, nginx, services, monitoring)
- **Log Management**: Hourly compressed log uploads to Spaces for centralized monitoring
- **Health Monitoring**: Comprehensive health checks and status endpoints
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Complete Pulumi deployment automation with configurable scaling
- **Security Hardening**: Services run as dedicated non-root user with VPC-isolated database

### Modern Frontend Experience
- **Mobile-First**: Touch-optimized image comparison with swipe gestures
- **Real-time Animations**: Framer Motion with spring physics
- **Progressive Web App**: Responsive design across all devices

### Production-Grade Feature Flags
- **Dual Deployment Support**: Single codebase for both full and lite modes
- **Build-Time Configuration**: Environment-based feature toggles
- **Graceful Degradation**: Lite mode maintains UX without backend
- **Service Layer Abstraction**: Clean separation between API and static data
- **Demonstrable Skill**: Shows sophisticated deployment practices for recruiters

## 💰 Cost Estimation

### Full Deployment (Digital Ocean)
**Monthly Costs (~$68/month with 2 droplets):**
- Load Balancer: $12/month
- 2 Droplets (s-2vcpu-2gb): $36/month ($18 each)
- Spaces Storage + CDN: $5/month (includes images and logs)
- Valkey Database (VPC-only): $15/month

**Scaling**: Add $18/month per additional droplet. Horizontal scaling is configured via `droplet_count` parameter.

**Note**: The s-2vcpu-2gb droplet configuration is required to handle full-stack deployment (backend Go API, frontend Next.js, nginx reverse proxy, and UserData bootstrapping). Smaller instances were insufficient during initial testing.

### Lite Deployment (GitHub Pages)
**Monthly Costs ($5/month):**
- GitHub Pages: $0/month (completely free)
- Spaces Storage + CDN: $5/month (shared with full deployment)

**Note**: DO Spaces is preserved during teardown to maintain images for lite deployment.

### Cost Optimization Strategy
**Recommended**: Keep lite deployment active ($5/month), spin up full deployment only for demos (~$2-3 per demo day with prorated billing).

**Annual Savings**: ~$756/year compared to continuous full deployment!

**AI Generation Costs:**
- Leverages free tiers across multiple providers
- Automatic cost optimization via intelligent provider selection

## 🚀 Deployment Options

This project uses **GitHub Actions workflows** for automated deployment and management of both architectures.

| **pricy-teardown.yml** | Destroy all DO resources | -$68/month |
| **pulumi-refresh.yml** | Sync Pulumi state with actual DO resources | $0 |

### Lite Deployment Workflows (GitHub Pages)

| Workflow | Purpose | Cost Impact |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| **cheap-deploy.yml** | Build and deploy static site to GitHub Pages | $0 |
