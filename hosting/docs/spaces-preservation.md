# DO Spaces Preservation During Teardown

## ✅ Fixed! Spaces Bucket is Now Protected

The `pricy-teardown.yml` workflow has been updated to **automatically preserve** the DO Spaces bucket and all images during infrastructure teardown.

## 🛡️ What Gets Preserved

When you run `pricy-teardown.yml`, these resources are **kept**:

✅ **DO Spaces Bucket** (`cgc-lb-and-cdn-content`)
✅ **All Images** in `/images/` directory
✅ **CDN Configuration** for fast delivery
✅ **Image Metadata** (stored in response headers)

## 🗑️ What Gets Destroyed

The teardown removes only the compute infrastructure:

❌ Load Balancer
❌ Droplets (all instances)
❌ Valkey Database Cluster
❌ Auto-created DNS A/AAAA records

## 🔧 How It Works

### Before (Old Behavior):
```yaml
1. Run pulumi destroy --yes
2. ❌ Attempts to delete Spaces bucket
3. ❌ Fails if bucket has content
4. 🔧 Manually removes from state
```

**Problem**: Could potentially delete all images!

### After (New Behavior):
```yaml
1. ✅ Remove Spaces from Pulumi state (preserves bucket)
2. ✅ Remove CDN from Pulumi state (preserves config)
3. Run pulumi destroy --yes
4. ✅ Only destroys compute infrastructure
```

**Result**: Images are always safe! 🎉

## 💰 Cost Impact

### Before Teardown:
- Load Balancer: $12/month
- Droplets (2x): $36/month
- Spaces + CDN: $5/month
- Valkey: $15/month
- **Total: $68/month**

### After Teardown:
- Load Balancer: ~~$12/month~~ ❌ Destroyed
- Droplets (2x): ~~$36/month~~ ❌ Destroyed
- Spaces + CDN: $5/month ✅ **Preserved**
- Valkey: ~~$15/month~~ ❌ Destroyed
- **Total: $5/month**

**Savings: $63/month** (down from $68/month)

## 🎯 Why Preserve Spaces?

1. **Lite Deployment Needs Images**: GitHub Pages deployment fetches image list from DO Spaces
2. **Expensive to Regenerate**: AI image generation costs money and time
3. **Historical Data**: Keeps all generated images for future use
4. **CDN Performance**: Maintains fast global delivery
5. **Metadata Preserved**: All prompts and provider info stays intact

## 📋 Workflow Output

When you run `pricy-teardown.yml`, you'll see:

```
### 🛡️ Preserving DO Spaces Bucket
DO Spaces bucket and images will be preserved for lite deployment
  ✅ Removed Spaces bucket from state (preserving actual bucket)
  ✅ Removed CDN from state (preserving CDN configuration)

### 🧹 Cleaning up auto-created DNS records
[DNS cleanup...]

### ✅ Infrastructure teardown complete!
💰 Monthly cost savings: ~$63/month

### 🛡️ Preserved Resources
The following resources were preserved for lite deployment:
- ✅ DO Spaces bucket 'cgc-lb-and-cdn-content' (~$5/month)
- ✅ All images in /images/ directory
- ✅ CDN configuration for fast image delivery

These resources are needed for the lite deployment on GitHub Pages.

### 💡 Total Monthly Cost After Teardown
- DO Spaces + CDN: $5/month (needed for lite deployment)
- GitHub Pages: $0/month (completely free)
- Total: $5/month (down from $68/month)
```

## 🔄 Integration with Lite Deployment

The preserved Spaces bucket seamlessly integrates with the lite deployment:

### Build Process:
```
1. cheap-deploy.yml runs
2. generate-static-data.js script fetches from DO Spaces
3. Lists all objects in /images/ directory
4. Reads metadata from response headers
5. Generates image-pairs.json
6. Builds static site with real images
7. Deploys to GitHub Pages
```

### Result:
- ✅ Lite deployment always has fresh data
- ✅ No manual JSON updates needed
- ✅ Real images with real metadata
- ✅ Works even when full deployment is down

## 🚀 Deployment Strategy

### Recommended Flow:

1. **Initial Setup**:
   ```
   pricy-deploy.yml → Generate images → Upload to Spaces
   ```

2. **Switch to Cost-Saving Mode**:
   ```
   dns-cutover.yml (target: github-pages)
   pricy-teardown.yml → Saves $63/month, keeps images
   cheap-deploy.yml → Uses preserved images
   ```

3. **Demo Day**:
   ```
   pricy-deploy.yml → Spin up full features (~10 min)
   dns-cutover.yml (target: digital-ocean)
   [Demo AI generation, live voting, etc.]
   dns-cutover.yml (target: github-pages)
   pricy-teardown.yml → Saves $63/month again
   ```

## 🔒 Safety Features

The workflow has multiple safety measures:

1. **Confirmation Required**: Must type "DESTROY" to run
2. **Proactive Preservation**: Removes Spaces from state BEFORE destroy
3. **Clear Output**: Shows exactly what's preserved vs destroyed
4. **Cost Transparency**: Reports actual monthly costs
5. **Documentation**: Explains why resources are preserved

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Spaces Bucket Lifecycle:
- ✅ Created by `pricy-deploy.yml` (first run)
- ✅ Preserved by `pricy-teardown.yml` (always)
- ✅ Reused by next `pricy-deploy.yml` (if exists)
- ℹ️ Must be manually deleted if you want to remove it

### Manual Deletion (If Needed):
If you want to completely remove the Spaces bucket:

1. Go to Digital Ocean console
2. Navigate to Spaces
3. Find bucket: `cgc-lb-and-cdn-content`
4. Delete bucket (⚠️ **This will delete all images!**)

**Only do this if you're sure you don't need the images!**
